# Harugo CLI 
<strong>This project is currently under active development.</strong>

Harugo is an interactive CLI app for building themed Next.js static sites. You can easily choose pages, components, and themes to create your unique site. Star to support our work! ‚≠ê

Once you launch the CLI, you will be able to:
- Create Pages
- Select Components for these pages
- Select Themes
- And finally, initialize the Next.js project

# Contribution
 Create base components & themes! You will be able to even modify the base layout with ease with the help of <strong>Dynamic Component Replacement</strong>.<br/>
 In essence, by declaring your own version of certain components (e.g., Navbar), it will take precedence over the original one. Once you are ready, hit that `Create PR` button!
